# FTIR-food-library
FTIR_Library_Spectra contains example FTIR spectra of a variety of foods and ingredients (oils, fruit/vegetables, coffee,...)

These were collected at various resolutions and using different sampling accessories according to the sample type (see  the 'FTIR_Library_Descriptions' file for details)

Spectra are arranged one per column, with preceding column containing frequency (wavenumber) values. Spectra are of varying length, depending on the resolution and the spectral range acquired. For convenience, spectra are also supplied truncated to the fingerprint region only.
